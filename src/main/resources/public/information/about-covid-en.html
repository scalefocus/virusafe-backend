      <h1>Questions and answers about COVID-19</h1>

      <h3>
        1. What is COVID-19? What is SARS-CoV-2?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The new coronavirus 2019 is now called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
        Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease associated with it is
        COVID-19.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Where did the coronaviruses come from?</h3>
      <p>
        Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate in animals, but some are known
        to affect humans as well. Once infected, they can eventually be
        transmitted from person to person.
      </p>
      <p>
        A wide variety of animals are known to be the source of coronaviruses.
        For example, the virus causing Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome
        (MERS-CoV) is a camel-derived coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory
        syndrome (SARS) is derived from a special cat species.
      </p>
      <p>
        More information on coronaviruses can be found on the website of the
        European Center for Disease Prevention and Control:

        </a>
      </p>
      <h3>3. Is this virus comparable to SARS or seasonal influenza?</h3>
      <p>
        The new coronavirus, discovered in China, has been genetically closely
        linked to the SARS virus since 2003 and appears to have similar
        characteristics, although data on the virus is still limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        SARS appeared in late 2002 in China and over 8,000 cases from 33
        countries have been reported for eight months. Back then one in ten
        SARS-infected people died
      </p>
      <p>
        The current epidemic of COVID-19 has caused about 10,000 cases in China
        in the first month of its occurrence only (from late December 2019 to
        late January 2020). Subsequently, cases have been reported by other
        countries, incl. some from the EU / EEA. There is too little data
        available at this stage to say for sure how deadly COVID-19 is, but
        preliminary data suggest that it is less fatal than SARS-CoV (SARS).
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the two viruses, as well as the flu viruses, are transmitted
        from person to person and can cause similar symptoms, they are very
        different and therefore manifest differently. It is still too early to
        conclude on the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but preliminary information
        indicates that it is transmitted in the same way as the SARS pathogen
        and some other pandemic influenza strains. According to the European
        Center for Disease Control (ECDC), up to 40,000 people in the EU / EEA
        die prematurely from influenza causes each year.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4. How is the infection transmitted? How easy is it to spread?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although animals are the source of the infection, the virus is now
        transmitted from person to person. There is currently not enough
        epidemiological information to confirm how easily and persistently the
        virus is transmitted between humans. The virus appears to be transmitted
        mainly through air droplets when people sneeze, cough or exhale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e., the time of contact with the
        patient and the onset of symptoms) is currently calculated from 2 to 14
        days. By now it is clear that the virus can be transmitted by infected
        persons when they have (flu-like) symptoms. It is not yet clear whether
        individuals with mild clinical complaints as well as asymptomatic
        carriers can transmit the infection.
      </p>

      <h2>
        MEDICAL INFORMATION
      </h2>
      <h3>
        1. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
      </h3>
      <p>
        As of now, the virus can cause mild flu-like symptoms such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Coughing</li>
        <li>Difficulty in breathing</li>
        <li>Muscle pain and fatigue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More serious cases can develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory
        distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock that can lead to the death of
        the patient. People with pre-existing chronic conditions appear to be
        more prone to serious illness.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Are some people more susceptible to the virus?</h3>
      <p>
        In general, the elderly and those with comorbid conditions (e.g.
        arterial hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, liver disease and
        respiratory disease) are expected to be at greater risk of developing
        severe symptoms.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Is there any treatment for COVID-19?</h3>
      <p>
        There is no specific treatment for this disease, so the approach used to
        treat patients with infections associated with the new coronavirus is to
        treat the clinical symptoms (such as fever, shortness of breath).
        Supportive care (for example, maintenance therapy and monitoring -
        oxygen therapy, maintaining body fluid balance and antiviral drugs) can
        be very effective for patients.
      </p>
      <h3>4. When should I test for COVID-19?</h3>
      <p>If you have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acute respiratory infection (sudden onset of at least one
          manifestation: cough, fever or difficulty breathing
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As well:</p>
      <p>
        Within 14 days before the onset of symptoms, at least one of the
        following epidemiological criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Close contact with a probable or confirmed case of COVID-19</li>
        <li>A history of travel to China and Italy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Close contact is defined as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing a household with a COVID-19 patient</li>
        <li>
          Direct physical contact with a patient with COVID-19 (e.g. handshake)
        </li>
        <li>
          Direct unprotected contact with infectious secretions of a patient
          with COVID-19 (eg, with a sneeze, touching the patient's bare hand
          wipes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Direct (face-to-face) contact with a patient with COVID-19 up to 2
          meters away and lasting more than 15 minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay indoors (e.g. classroom, hospital, meeting room, etc.) with a
          patient with COVID-19 for â‰¥ 15 minutes and at least 2 meters away
        </li>
        <li>
          A healthcare professional or other person directly caring for a
          patient with COVID-19 or laboratory personnel processing clinical
          samples of a patient with COVID-19 without the recommended personal
          protective equipment or possibly impaired integrity of personal
          vehicles
        </li>
        <li>
          Traveling by airplane close to a person with COVID-19 (up to two seats
          in all directions), travel companion or careers, crew members serving
          the sector where the patient sits (if the severity of the symptoms in
          the patient or his relocation / movement indicates that other or all
          passengers on the aircraft may be identified for greater exposure to
          close contact).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
      <h3>1. How can I prevent myself from becoming infected?</h3>
      <p>
        When visiting areas or countries with registered COVID-19 cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid contact with sick people, especially those with cough</li>
        <li>
          Avoid visits to markets or places where animals are dead or alive
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply general hygiene rules to hand and food hygiene
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash your hands with soap and water OR use an alcohol-based
          disinfectant solution before eating, after using the toilet, and after
          any contact with animals
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid contact with animals, their faeces.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Wherever you travel, follow the general rules for hand and food hygiene.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2. What should I do if I have contacted someone with COVID-19?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Inform health authorities for follow-up guidance. Observe yourself from
        the time of contact with this person and if you develop any symptoms,
        consult your healthcare provider for advice and tell him that you have
        been in contact with a COVID-19 positive patient.
      </p>
      <h3>3. What are the rules for infection / hand washing?</h3>
      <p>
        Washing and disinfecting hands is the key to preventing from infection.
        You should wash your hands frequently and copiously with soap and water
        for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, you can
        also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. The
        virus enters your body through the eyes, nose and mouth, so avoid
        touching them with unwashed hands.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?</h3>
      <p>
        Face masks help prevent the spread of infection from those who are ill
        to other people around them. Face masks don't seem to be as effective at
        protecting those who aren't infected.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Is there a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2?</h3>
      <p>
        There is currently no vaccine for coronaviruses, including the
        SARS-CoV-2 strain. That is why it is very important to prevent infection
        or to keep the infection from spreading.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6. Am I protected against the SARS-CoV-2 virus if I was vaccinated
        against the flu this year?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Flu and 2019-nCoV are two very different viruses and a seasonal flu
        vaccine would not protect against diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2.
